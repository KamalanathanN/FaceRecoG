The above links are tutorials for the codes.......
BUT the tutorial uses OPENCV version 2.x and pyhton 2.x
the problem is that i couldnt find a proper gitcode to implement the code in the tutorial with latest OPENCV 3.3.0 and python2.7
it seems OPENCV version 3.3.0 has many changes in its function call's when compared with OPENCV 2.X
so i have made changes in code to support OPENCV 3.3.0 in python 2.7

# Make folders named : "dataset" and "trainer" in your program directory

# Note : Changes have been made to run in openCV 3.3.0 and you can compare with the above link and given code to know the changes!!!!!
